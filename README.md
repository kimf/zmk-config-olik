*(Optimized Lagom Input Construction)*

**OLIK 47** is a handwired, 3D-printed split ergonomic keyboard designed with a nod to robust Swedish industrial engineering. It embraces asymmetry ("Olik" means *Different* or *Unlike* in Swedish) to provide exactly what is needed—and nothing more.

Built around the Swedish concept of **Lagom** (not too much, not too little, just right), the OLIK 47 avoids extreme minimalism in favor of practicality. It features a dedicated arrow cluster, a rotary encoder, and a tilted "wedge" profile for ergonomic comfort without complex adjustable legs.


## 🇸🇪 The Philosophy

Most split keyboards try to be perfectly symmetrical. The **OLIK** acknowledges that our needs for the left and right hands are often different.

* **Left Hand:** 22 Keys + OLED. Focused on modifiers and alphas.
* **Right Hand:** 24 Keys + Rotary Encoder. Focused on navigation (arrows), entry, and system control (volume/play/pause).

## ✨ Features

* **Asymmetric Layout:** 46 physical keys + 1 Encoder click (Total 47 inputs).
* **Handwired Matrix:** No PCB. Just wires, diodes, and patience.
* **Industrial Retro Aesthetic:** Designed to look like heavy machinery or 80s avionics, featuring a robust "wedge" case with integrated tenting and tilt.
* **Hardware:**
* 1x EC11 Rotary Encoder (Right half)
* 1x OLED Display (Left half)
* Controllers: Pro Micro NRF52840
